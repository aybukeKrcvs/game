When you entered the labyrinth, the paths got mixed up. 
At first everything seemed normal but as you took steps it became harder and harder to find the exit. 
You didn't know which way to go, everything looked the same. 
But after a while, you noticed a KEY in an old stone by the wall. 
DO NOT FORGET TO PICKUP THE KEY, you finally found a door.
