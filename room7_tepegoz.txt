You entered a place that was cold, damp, made you feel uneasy and looked like a large cave. 
There were spooky drawings on the walls of the cave. 
You heard snoring and noticed a giant bed and a sleeping creature in the corner of the room. 
You had to try to slowly exit the room without waking it. 
You noticed a lock on the door across from you. Do you have the key to unlock it?

As you slowly walked towards the door, you hit some bone pieces and the sound echoed in the room. 
You woke the monster because of the sound.
This CANNOT be the Cyclops with one eye in those legends.

It only takes damage from its eye. Be careful.
