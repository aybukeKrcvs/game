When you notice the object, you immediately approach it. 
But at that very moment, a sound comes from the ground.
You were right about your feelings. You should never have come close to taking the items.
 
A mechanism is activated; the ground trembles, the walls creak and come closer together. 
At that moment, every corner of the room begins to surround you. 
Suddenly, a faint light seeps from the dark corners and only your fearful gaze remains.

You fall into the trap of the room, you don't find a single opportunity to escape. 
You slowly begin to collapse; you grow weaker, your body weakens with hunger and thirst with each passing minute. 
Finally, when you need another sip of water, your eyes begin to darken. 
At that moment, everything goes silent, and the game is over.
