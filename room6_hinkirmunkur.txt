There are humming sounds in the room as if the wind is blowing. 
The moment you enter the room, you encounter a scary creature. It has claws. 
You see that it has a pouch on its belly and that there is a baby there. 
It is the Hınkır Munkur, who eats people after strangling them. 
It is approaching you, you must fight!
