There is an shiny and glamorous chest in the middle of the room.
There may be items inside the chest that will help you escape from this dungeon. 
But something about the room feels off. Maybe you shouldn't take the items. 
WHAT IF there's a very sharp sword?

Do not be scared. Go and take a closer look.
